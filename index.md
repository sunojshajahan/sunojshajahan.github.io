### My research
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, IL, specializing in Computational Engineering for Precision Agriculture. My research centers on utilizing advanced data analytics to process multi-source geospatial data, including machine learning and deep learning. I am dedicated to developing data-driven decision support tools for agriculture that operate in near real-time. 

I am passionate about leveraging free and open-source software (FOSS) platforms for geospatial data analysis and tool development. I create workflows for analyzing geospatial data and images in QGIS, R, ImageJ, and Python. I believe the open source culture ensures widespread access and fosters transparency, credibility, and practicality for farmers.

Previously, my efforts were on predicting field-scale corn yield and mapping variability using drone and satellite imagery. I am interested in adding other data layers like weather, topography, and equipment log data to understand the crop growing dynamics in the growing season.
